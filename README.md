CSLabs
======

Some of the more funner labs in my CS days. Most from Data Structures course taught by kick ass professor Dr. Rolf Lakaemper of Temple University.

To build GameOfLife: make sure you include the WireWorld jar.
To build WhackAButton: Make sure all the assets are relative to the compiled class. or manually change the paths in the src.
